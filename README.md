// CURRENT STATE OF SOLUTION //
- proof of concept compiles
- methods function correctly
- user accounts may place bets for one of two outcomes, prize may be distributed to winner
  
 // TO-DO LIST //
 - add much additional functionality: define contests, various checks to stop dodgy behaviour, etc. (leave proof_of_concept.sol as is and move to new file?)
 - explore available sports APIs and integrate
 - consider alternate odds schemas; outcome matrices, additional complexity
 - deploy to test chain (not until much later?)
